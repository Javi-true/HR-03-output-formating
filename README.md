# HackerRank Challenge: Formatting Output with printf

## Problem Description

This challenge tests your understanding of formatting output in Java using `System.out.printf`. The task is to format and print input strings and integers into two specified columns with proper alignment and padding.

### Input Format
Each line of input contains:
1. A string (maximum 10 alphabetic characters).
2. An integer (in the inclusive range of 0 to 999).

### Output Format
For each input line:
1. The first column contains the string, left-justified and padded with spaces to be exactly 15 characters wide.
2. The second column contains the integer, displayed in a 3-digit format with leading zeroes if necessary.

The output starts and ends with a line of `=` repeated 32 times.
